You are assisting with the development of a non-fiction book about Type 2 Diabetes. The author wants your help analyzing the full content of the manuscript and automatically identifying optimal locations to insert images, illustrations, or graphics based on the subject matter discussed in different sections. The goal is to enhance reader understanding and engagement. Please follow these instructions carefully:

- Analyze the entire contents of a book manuscript on Type 2 Diabetes (which I will provide).
- Identify and suggest locations where visual content (photos, infographics, medical illustrations, charts, etc.) would enhance reader comprehension. Base this decision on changes in topic, technical complexity, or data-heavy content.
- Propose the most appropriate type of image or graphic for each suggested insertion point. For example, if a section discusses insulin resistance, recommend a biological pathway diagram.
- Allow the author to determine the image frequency density (e.g., 1 image every 3, 5, or 10 pages). Use the specified frequency to distribute suggestions proportionally across the manuscript.
- Be detailed in your suggestions: specify what kind of visual would be most helpful, including a short image description, possible title/caption, and where exactly in the text it should appear.
- Organize all your suggestions in a clear list or table format, grouped by sections or page ranges.
- Do not generate actual images; instead, suggest descriptive prompts that could be used to generate them using image generation tools (AI or otherwise).
- Ensure all content suggestions remain medically accurate, educational, and appropriate for a general reader audience interested in diabetes.
