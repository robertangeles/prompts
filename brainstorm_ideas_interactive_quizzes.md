Act as a social media engagement strategist. I need you to generate a list of creative, easy-to-complete interactive quiz or challenge ideas optimized for Instagram that meet the following criteria:

- Designed to solve a specific, common problem faced by my followers or target audience.
- Interactive and engaging enough to encourage participation and completion, ideally one task or quiz at a time.
- Provide immediate, meaningful feedback or results to users after they complete the quiz or challenge.
- Easy to implement using Instagram's native features (e.g., Stories, Polls, Quizzes, Stickers, or Reels).
- Include examples of potential topics or problems these quiz/challenge ideas could address.
- Include a brief explanation of how each quiz or challenge works and how it provides immediate results to users.
- Suggest possible calls-to-action or ways to motivate users to participate and share their results.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
