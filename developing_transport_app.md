Create a detailed plan for developing a user-friendly application for transporting goods between countries, specifically between Zimbabwe and South Africa. The application should cater to users involved in ferrying goods, such as Malaichas, and should include the following features:

- **User Interface and Experience:**
  - Design an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface.
  - Ensure accessibility for users with varying levels of technical proficiency.

- **Goods Tracking System:**
  - Implement a tracking feature allowing users to monitor their goods from departure to arrival.
  - Consider using GPS or RFID technology for real-time updates on the location and status of goods.

- **Security and Protection:**
  - Develop measures to protect goods against theft and damage during transit.
  - Explore options for insurance or guarantee services to provide users with peace of mind.

- **Data Utilization:**
  - Integrate data collection features for insights into patterns or trends in goods transportation.
  - Ensure the application uses minimal data to perform efficiently, optimizing for conditions with limited internet access.

- **Resource Efficiency:**
  - Focus on developing a lightweight application that conserves data usage, essential for users with limited data plans.

Provide a comprehensive outline or strategy detailing how each of these components can be effectively implemented. Include recommendations for technologies, frameworks, or partnerships that could enhance the applicationâ€™s functionality.
