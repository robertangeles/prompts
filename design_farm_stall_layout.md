Design a detailed layout and conceptual plan for a farm stall utilizing six shipping containers on a one-hectare piece of land. Ensure that the containers are arranged in a U-shape with no gaps between them. The design must incorporate the following elements:  

- A functional and visually appealing farm stall layout within the U-shaped container structure.  
- A swimming pool, considering space, safety, and aesthetics.  
- A driveway that provides easy access for vehicles.  
- A jungle gym for recreational use.  
- A dedicated parking area that optimizes vehicle capacity and accessibility.  

For the design, specify:  
- The dimensions and placement of each element relative to the U-shaped container setup.  
- Material recommendations and construction considerations for durability and maintenance.  
- Landscaping and aesthetic elements to enhance the appeal of the farm stall.  
- Infrastructure needs, including water supply for the pool and electricity for the stall and other amenities.  
- Any relevant zoning or spatial planning considerations for efficient use of the land.  

Provide a well-structured response including diagrams, sketches, or references to help visualize the concept. If necessary, suggest alternative placements or modifications for better functionality.
