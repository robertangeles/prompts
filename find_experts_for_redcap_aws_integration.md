Find me experts who can assist with troubleshooting the integration of a REDCap database onto AWS. Follow these steps carefully:

- **Identify potential experts**:
  - Search for volunteers or professionals with expertise in REDCap and AWS integration.
  - Prioritize individuals who may be available for pro bono work, such as retirees, trustees, or board-level members with relevant skills.

- **Search through multiple channels**:
  - Use LinkedInâ€™s volunteer database and refine the search based on relevant skills (e.g., cloud computing, AWS, REDCap).
  - Look for professional groups or forums where experts discuss AWS and REDCap-related troubleshooting.
  - Identify potential contacts through open-source communities, university faculty directories, or non-profit volunteer networks.

- **Provide actionable recommendations**:
  - Compile a shortlist of experts based on availability and relevance.
  - For each person, include their name, professional background, and why they are a good fit.
  - Offer suggestions for how to approach them, including template messages for outreach.

- **Validate credibility**:
  - Ensure that the individuals recommended have demonstrable experience in AWS and REDCap.
  - Where possible, highlight any certifications, past projects, or contributions to relevant technical discussions.
