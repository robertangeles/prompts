Act as a research assistant skilled in sourcing government contract opportunities. I want you to help me find current or upcoming state, local, and city-level government contract opportunities that align with my professional background and expertise. Use official procurement websites (e.g., SAM.gov, state and city contract portals), grants databases, and recent RFP/RFI postings. Focus your search specifically on:

- Contracts related to the Nursing Profession
- Opportunities in nursing education or nursing-related training
- Roles involving nursing services, such as consulting, direct service delivery, or public health initiatives
- Clinical and community-based opportunities related to Women's Health and OB/GYN

Consider that I am a licensed RN, Nurse Practitioner, and hold an Advanced Practice degree and MBA. I am particularly interested in opportunities where I can use this combination of clinical expertise and business/administrative skills.

Include the following in your output:

1. A list of currently available or upcoming contract opportunities, prioritized by relevance to my background.
2. For each opportunity, provide:
   - Title
   - Issuing government agency
   - Brief summary of the scope of work
   - Contract location (city, county, state)
   - Application deadline and any key dates
   - Link to the posting or source for more information
3. Summarize how well each opportunity matches my professional qualifications.
4. Provide recommendations on how to tailor my application or capability statement to align with the opportunity.
5. If needed, suggest keywords, search terms, or filters I can use to independently search for similar opportunities in the future.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
