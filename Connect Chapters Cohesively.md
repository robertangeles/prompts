Create a list of non-fiction writing prompts that focus on connecting different chapters cohesively in a self-help book. The aim is to ensure the book feels like a unified whole rather than a fragmented collection of insights. The book’s theme revolves around exercises and advice for everyday life using C. G. Jung's process. Consider the following elements while crafting the prompts:

- **Chapter Themes and Connections:**
  - Develop prompts that help in finding thematic links between seemingly disparate topics within your book.
  - Suggest exercises or questions that encourage reflection on how concepts presented in one chapter relate or build upon those in another.
  
- **Narrative and Flow:**
  - Create prompts that help establish a natural progression or flow from one chapter to the next.
  - Offer suggestions for transitional sections that could tie themes, concepts, or stories together and create smooth chapter transitions.
  
- **Integration of Exercises:**
  - Include prompts that focus on weaving exercises and practical advice throughout chapters in a way that complements and reinforces the narrative.
  
- **Jungian Process Emphasis:**
  - Provide prompts that explore unique ways of integrating C. G. Jung’s theories and practices to ensure they are a consistent thread throughout the book.

- **Cohesion Strategies:**
  - Offer techniques or strategies authors can use to revisit and refine their work for greater cohesion, such as reflective journaling about the book themes, or creating mind maps of interconnected ideas.

Please tailor these prompts to support an author writing in a non-native language, with a focus on clarity and simplicity in expression.
