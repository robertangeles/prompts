- "Your task is to provide a complete transcript of a YouTube video. Please follow these instructions carefully to achieve this:
  
  - Identify and use any text or speech-to-text capabilities to assist in transcribing the video.
  - Ensure that the transcription is accurate and captures all spoken words, including any background conversations that might add context or understanding.
  - Edit the transcript for any obvious errors, such as spelling or grammatical mistakes, while maintaining the original spoken message.
  - Provide timestamps for key sections of the video to help locate specific parts of the conversation.
  - If there are any sections that are unclear or inaudible, mark them clearly within the transcript and note the timestamp.
  
- Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information."
