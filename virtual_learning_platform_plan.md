I need help designing a comprehensive plan to launch a virtual learning platform targeted at schools and students, focused on teaching AI, digital marketing, and how to make money online. Please break this down into the following steps and provide specific tools, workflows, and instructions:

- Suggest the best virtual class platform or tech stack (e.g., similar to Blackboard or Skool) that integrates community-based learning and allows live classes, resource sharing, forums, and progress tracking.
- Describe how I can use ChatGPT Pro’s Operator feature to:
    - Automate communications with schools or educational institutions to offer these virtual classes.
    - Set up workflows for student onboarding, class scheduling, and progress tracking.
    - Leverage plugins, APIs, or integrations to enhance functionality (e.g., email, CRM tools, learning management systems).
- Provide a step-by-step strategy for reaching out to schools including drafting sample outreach emails and explaining how AI tools can assist with bulk outreach, segmentation, and follow-up.
- Outline a curriculum structure that teaches AI fundamentals, digital marketing strategies, and practical online income generation use cases, especially tailored for young learners.
- Recommend real-life AI tools and platforms that students can apply during the course, including project ideas and monetization opportunities.
- Explain how to evaluate student performance, build peer communities, and encourage collaboration within the platform.
- Offer ways to monetize the platform — e.g., subscriptions, certifications, premium content, or affiliate programs.
- Suggest how to use AI (e.g., ChatGPT + Operator) to maintain and scale the platform, including customer support, analytics, and content updates.
