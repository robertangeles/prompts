Create a 10–12-slide presentation deck for a career day talk aimed at high school students. The goal is to inspire and inform them through a personal career journey, emphasizing that career paths are often non-linear. Use the following guidance to structure the deck:

- Title Slide: Include a compelling title that reflects the theme (e.g., “Careers Are Not Linear: My Journey from Law to School Leadership”).
  
- Introductory Slide: Briefly introduce the presenter’s current role and purpose of the talk.

- Career Path Slides:
  - Depict the transition from working as an international lawyer to becoming a school leader.
  - Highlight key milestones, turning points, and lessons learned at each stage.
  - Emphasize why and how the presenter transitioned from law to education.

- Passion and Purpose Slide: Discuss how personal passions evolved over time, and how they informed the presenter’s career changes.

- Foundational Skills Slide: Outline key foundational skills and mindsets (e.g., communication, problem-solving, curiosity, perseverance) that helped navigate career pivots.

- Theme Slide: Explain the central theme: "Careers are not linear. Get the foundations right and pursue your passion." Provide relatable examples.

- AI in Education Slides:
  - Introduce the presenter’s current work in integrating AI in education.
  - Explain why this area is exciting and important for students and educators.
  - Share practical or visionary implications of AI for learning.

- Reflective/Takeaway Slide:
  - Summarize 3-5 key messages or takeaways for students.
  - Encourage students to explore, be open to change, and invest in lifelong learning.

- Call to Action or Closing Slide:
  - Leave students with a question or challenge to reflect on their own future possibilities.
  - Include an inspirational quote, if appropriate.

Use a student-friendly tone, simple language, and a mix of visuals and storytelling elements. Design the structure to maintain engagement and curiosity throughout. Suggest visuals, graphics, or metaphors that will help reinforce the message that career progression doesn’t have to follow a straight line.
