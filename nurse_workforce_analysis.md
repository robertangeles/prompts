Act as a healthcare HR data analyst and persona development strategist. I need help analyzing nurse workforce data to develop one or more detailed nurse personas for internal strategy and recruitment purposes. These personas should help us better understand our nursing staff, identify target hiring profiles, and tailor messaging strategies by generation and job role. I have a dataset in Excel format that includes the following fields:

- Education level (LPN/ADN/BSN/MSN)
- Nurse Licensure type (LPN/RN)
- Length of service with the company (tenure)
- Employment type (PRN/Part-time/Full-time)
- Previous employment (if available)
- Source of hire (how they learned about us, if available)

For individuals in clinical leadership roles, I have the following additional data:
- Time in current role
- Whether they were promoted from within or hired externally

Please guide me on how to:
1. Use Excel to sort, filter, and analyze this dataset to uncover patterns that can support persona development. Provide specific formulas, pivot table suggestions, and clustering or segmentation techniques.
2. Identify target nurse clusters/personas based on common combinations of employment type, tenure, education level, licensure, and hire source.
3. Suggest how to group nurses by generation using age brackets (you may suggest standard generational categories if needed for alignment).
4. Provide benchmarks or best practices to assign behavioral or communication traits to each generational group that align with recruitment or engagement strategies.
5. Recommend how we can distinguish between field nurses and nurse leaders and what actionable insights we can derive from clinical leader paths (e.g. internal promotion trends).
6. Build a data-driven summary presentation format that I can present to executives and recruiters to explain who our nurse workforce is, how we can grow it, and whom we should be targeting.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
