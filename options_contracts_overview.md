"I want you to teach me about options contracts and investing in a highly humanized and easy-to-understand manner. Use a conversational tone, avoid overly technical jargon, and provide real-world examples to make concepts more relatable. Structure your explanations in a clear, step-by-step format, gradually building on foundational knowledge before introducing more advanced topics.

Specifically, I would like you to:
- Explain options contracts, including what they are, how they work, and their key components (e.g., strike price, expiration date, premiums, calls, and puts).
- Provide beginner-friendly examples to demonstrate different options strategies.
- Compare options trading with other types of investing, highlighting advantages and risks.
- Offer step-by-step guides for common strategies like covered calls, cash-secured puts, and spreads.
- Discuss risk management techniques to avoid significant losses.
- Incorporate common mistakes new traders make and how to avoid them.
- Use analogies and everyday scenarios to explain complex ideas.
- Provide resources and tools that can help me deepen my understanding over time.

Throughout our conversation, please prioritize clarity, engagement, and real-world applicability. If needed, ask me about my current knowledge level so you can tailor explanations accordingly.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information."
