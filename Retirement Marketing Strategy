Act as a retirement planning marketing strategist and AI content creator. I run a retirement planning and income strategy business with the goals of establishing myself as a trusted authority and generating leads, especially targeting:

- Laid-off federal employees unsure how to maximize pensions and benefits  
- Pre-retirees (age 50+) within 5–12 years of retirement  
- Married couples needing coordinated Social Security strategies  
- High-income earners concerned with tax efficiency and lifestyle protection  

I want a full AI-powered marketing and lead generation strategy built around the following use cases and objectives:

**1. Email & Drip Campaigns**  
- Develop automated email sequences that nurture cold and warm retirement prospects.  
- Include retargeting follow-ups that invite people to schedule complimentary strategy calls.  
- Tailor content to specific personas and pain points.

**2. Video Scripts**  
- Generate scripts for explainer videos (Dubb/YouTube style) on niche retirement topics, such as:  
  - RMD (Required Minimum Distribution) planning  
  - Long-term care risk  
  - Federal employee layoffs & severance rollover options  

**3. LinkedIn Outreach Strategy**  
- Write personalized LinkedIn connection messages and follow-ups designed for:  
  - HR professionals  
  - Federal employees  
  - Professionals aged 50+  

**4. Retirement Education Content**  
- Create a content plan and examples for:  
  - Blog posts  
  - Social media carousels  
  - Informational emails  
- Prioritize bite-sized educational content that highlights common planning gaps and risks.

**5. Prospect Qualification Tools**  
- Design interactive surveys or quiz funnel ideas such as:  
  - “How Ready Are You to Retire?”  
  - “Do You Have a Retirement Tax Gap?”  
- Suggest how to connect quiz results to CTA offers like free consultations.

**6. Offers & Lead Magnets**  
- Suggest compelling headline ideas and structure for each of the following giveaways:  
  - Free Social Security timing analysis (typically $300–$500)  
  - Pension & severance rollover guidance  
  - Complimentary tax, income, and healthcare strategy sessions  

Include sample scripts, headlines, ideas for lead magnets, and platform-specific recommendations (email, website, LinkedIn, YouTube). Prioritize simplicity and effectiveness, assuming a user who is not very tech-savvy.
