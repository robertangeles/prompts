Here is the final ChatGPT prompt:

â€”

Create a teleprompter script of at least 2400 spoken words for a video. Follow these specific guidelines:

- The content must be clearly formatted for teleprompter use: short, easily readable lines; clear breaks for natural pauses; conversational tone suitable for spoken delivery.
- Maintain a coherent structure with an engaging introduction, informative body, and compelling conclusion.
- Choose a topic that is informative, engaging, and can naturally sustain 2400+ words of continuous speaking. List 3-5 potential topic ideas first, and briefly explain why each would work well for a long-form video. Wait for confirmation of the final topic before proceeding.
- Once the topic is confirmed, outline the key sections or arguments before writing the full script. Wait for approval of the outline if needed.
- Ensure the script flows smoothly and logically from start to finish, keeping audience engagement in mind throughout.
- Use natural language, contractions, rhetorical devices (like questions to the audience), and appropriate levels of enthusiasm and emphasis.
- Indicate pacing cues if necessary (e.g., [pause], [take a breath], [emphasize]), but keep them minimal and non-disruptive.
- Double-check that the final script reaches at least 2400 words of actual spoken content (excluding instructions, pacing cues, headings).
