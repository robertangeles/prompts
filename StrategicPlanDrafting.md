**ChatGPT Prompt:**  

"I need your help in drafting a comprehensive strategic plan for a non-profit organization based on notes and information from a strategy session. The plan should adhere to best practices and include the following components:  

- **Mission Statement:** A concise yet impactful statement summarizing the organization's purpose.  
- **Vision Statement:** A forward-looking statement describing the ideal future state the organization aims to achieve.  
- **Core Values:** A list of guiding principles that define the organization's culture and decision-making.  
- **Strategic Priorities:** Key areas of focus that will drive the organizationâ€™s success over the next few years.  
- **Objectives:** Specific, measurable goals that align with the strategic priorities.  

Once the strategic plan is created, summarize it into a one-page version for quick reference. This condensed version should be easily shareable with the governance board, community members, and families being served.  

Additionally, use the strategic plan to outline an annual plan that prioritizes key initiatives, timelines, and responsibilities for the upcoming year. Ensure it is actionable and aligned with the strategic objectives.  

Structure your response in a clear and professional manner, using compelling and accessible language suited for diverse stakeholders.  

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information."
