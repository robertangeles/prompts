You are a social media strategist and small business consultant. Create a comprehensive, step-by-step Instagram growth strategy for a new Instagram page built around a security network. The goal of the page is to:

- Connect security guards with companies and businesses looking to hire them.
- Help individuals become security guards by providing educational resources and job opportunities.
- Grow the Instagram page quickly to build brand awareness and attract both guards and businesses.
- Establish a brand similar to Airbnb, but for the security industryâ€”acting as a trusted platform for matching clients with service providers.

Your response should include:

- A clear, step-by-step weekly content plan for posts and stories (with post types, captions, hashtags, and timing).
- Types of daily posts to include (e.g., job alerts, training tips, testimonials, industry news, company spotlights, etc.).
- Examples of Instagram Stories to use for engagement, including interactive features (polls, quizzes, sliders, Q&A, etc.).
- Guidelines on branding, tone of voice, and visual consistency (including any tools that might help).
- Hashtag strategy specific to the security and staffing/recruitment industry.
- Tips for leveraging growth tactics (e.g., collaborating with influencers, paid ads, shoutouts, giveaways, community engagement).
- A system to consistently educate followers about the security field and show how to become/remain qualified.
- Recommendations on tracking success and measuring growth metrics weekly. 

Ensure your plan is suitable for a solo founder or very small team with limited resources. Your strategy should be actionable, organized, and detailed enough that it could be followed with minimal background knowledge.
