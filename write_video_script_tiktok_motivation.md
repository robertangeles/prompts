Create a script for a TikTok video that organically promotes health and wellness products on TikTok Shop. Your script should:

- Begin with an educational segment about common health or wellness symptoms that the product addresses.
- Include a relatable story or testimonial involving a close friend or someone familiar, illustrating how the product effectively solved their problem.
- Ensure compliance with TikTok Shop guidelines to prevent violations. Remember that health claims should be supported by evidence, and promotional content should adhere to advertising standards.
- Keep the content engaging and concise, suitable for TikTokâ€™s video length constraints.
- Do not include any personal or sensitive demographic information.

Before proceeding, ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
