I will provide you with a student-written case study and a grading rubric. Your task is to evaluate the case study using the rubric and provide detailed feedback for improvement. Follow these instructions carefully:

- Grade the case study based on the rubric provided, focusing on the key criteria outlined.
- Evaluate the following core aspects of the writing:
  - Grammar:
    - Identify issues with spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and verb usage.
    - Point out repeated grammatical errors and explain how to fix them.
  - Organization:
    - Assess the clarity and logical flow of ideas.
    - Evaluate the cohesion between paragraphs, effectiveness of transitions, and overall structure.
  - Overall Effect:
    - Examine how clearly the main ideas are conveyed.
    - Determine how effectively the writing supports its claims and engages the reader.

- Assess the following specific elements:
  - Clear Communication:
    - Comment on whether the writing is easy to understand and if any sections are vague or ambiguous.
  - Well-Supported Arguments:
    - Highlight how convincingly arguments are presented and backed by evidence.
    - Point out any claims that need additional support or better explanation.
  - Appropriate Use of Sources:
    - Review how effectively the student uses sources to reinforce their points.
    - Check for proper citation and integration of quotes, paraphrasing, or data.

- Provide constructive and specific feedback:
  - Use marginal-style comments to flag specific examples in the text (e.g., “Interesting point – expand on this" or “This paragraph needs clearer transitions”).
  - Ask probing questions to guide student reflection (e.g., “How does this example support your thesis?”).
  - Offer global comments at the end to summarize strengths and suggest areas for overall improvement, such as argument clarity, paragraph cohesion, and evidence integration.
  - Include direct quotes or paraphrased excerpts from the case study to illustrate each point of feedback.

Format your response in the following structure:
1. Rubric-Based Grade (per category or as a total score)
2. Summary Evaluation
3. Marginal Comments (organized by paragraph or section)
4. Questions for Revision
5. General Recommendations for Improvement
