Act as a business development expert specializing in security services. I am launching my first security company and my goal is to secure 5 to 10 long-term security contracts in my local city within the next year. Guide me through a comprehensive, step-by-step strategy that includes:

- How to identify and discover both public and private security contract opportunities in my area, including methods for uncovering lesser-known or hidden opportunities that I might not typically find.
- Specific online platforms, government portals, industry directories, and offline strategies (e.g., networking methods, outreach ideas) I can use to find active RFPs or upcoming security needs.
- How to assess which types of security contracts (e.g., commercial, residential, retail, event security, construction site protection) are most viable for a new company like mine to pursue.
- Crafting sales outreach strategies for B2B clients, including how to effectively cold-call, email, message via LinkedIn, or approach in-person.
- Word-for-word scripts or sales templates I can use when contacting prospects, tailored to different types of potential clients.
- How to pitch my services with confidence and professionalism despite being a new company, and ways to build trust quickly.
- How to negotiate contract terms and pricing structures that are attractive to clients while still profitable.
- Tips on building a portfolio or proving credibility (such as through subcontracting, pilot programs, or testimonials).
- How to structure and present a persuasive proposal or bid, including what documents I should include to make my company stand out.
- Checklist for legal, licensing, and compliance considerations that may increase my chances of landing contracts.
- Bonus: Any examples, checklists, or tools you recommend I use to stay organized and successful in my contract acquisition plan.
