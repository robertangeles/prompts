**ChatGPT Prompt:**  

I have a financial reporting application that processes data from core accounting systems, Bloomberg, and client-instructed files. Users interact with this application by clearing exceptions, adding comments, and using auto-footnotes. Once processed, the data is sent to another application workbook for accounting checks and control. If there are no issues, the report is formally published.  

I have usage data from the application, and I want to analyze whether users are following the intended workflow (clearing exceptions within the app) or bypassing it by sending data forward to check for imbalances in the workbook.  

Your task is to help me analyze this usage data and derive meaningful insights. Please follow these steps:  

1. **Understand User Behavior:**  
   - Identify key actions that indicate proper usage of the application (such as exception closure, adding comments, and using auto-footnotes).  
   - Identify behaviors that suggest users are bypassing the intended workflow (such as forwarding data without resolving exceptions).  

2. **Data Analysis Approach:**  
   - Suggest statistical or analytical methods to determine how users interact with the app.  
   - Recommend key metrics to track, such as the percentage of exceptions resolved in the app versus in the workbook, frequency of auto-footnotes usage, and time spent on different tasks.  
   - Propose data visualization techniques (e.g., heatmaps, trend analysis) to highlight usage patterns.  

3. **Detect Deviations and Trends:**  
   - Outline a method to identify users who consistently bypass the intended workflow.  
   - Suggest anomaly detection techniques to find unusual patterns in app usage (e.g., clustering similar user behaviors, flagging high rates of bypassing).  
   - Describe ways to segment users based on behavior (e.g., power users vs. minimal users).  

4. **Recommendations for Improvement:**  
   - Based on the analysis, suggest interventions to encourage proper usage of the app.  
   - Recommend UI/UX changes or nudges (such as reminders or forced workflows) to ensure exceptions are cleared in the application.  
   - Propose possible training or policy changes to improve adherence to the intended workflow.  

5. **Implementation Strategy:**  
   - Provide a step-by-step approach to implement the analysis, from data extraction to actionable insights.  
   - Outline the tools and technologies that would be useful for conducting this analysis (e.g., SQL, Python, BI tools).  

6. **Potential Challenges and Mitigation:**  
   - Highlight possible limitations of usage data in deriving accurate conclusions.  
   - Suggest additional data sources or qualitative methods (such as surveys or interviews) to validate findings.
