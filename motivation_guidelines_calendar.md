Create a comprehensive guideline for staying motivated and tracking progress effectively. The guideline should be presented in the form of a calendar. Consider including the following elements:

- **Daily tasks**: Suggest activities or habits to maintain motivation on a daily basis.
- **Weekly reviews**: Include prompts for reflecting on the week's achievements and areas for improvement.
- **Goal setting**: Provide strategies for setting short-term and long-term goals and integrating them into the calendar.
- **Motivational quotes or tips**: Incorporate small doses of motivation throughout the calendar.
- **Progress tracking methods**: Recommend tools or methods for tracking progress visually.

Additionally, explain the etiquette of sharing posts within this context. Is it acceptable to make all posts public?

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
