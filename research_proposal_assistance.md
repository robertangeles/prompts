- Consider the following aspects when guiding me:
  - **Research Topic Selection**: Propose innovative and relevant research topics that will capture attention.
  - **Research Questions**: Develop clear, concise, and thought-provoking research questions.
  - **Literature Review**: Suggest key areas of existing literature to review and incorporate that provide a solid foundation for my proposal.
  - **Methodology**: Outline potential methodologies appropriate for the study, detailing advantages, disadvantages, and the rationale for each.
  - **Significance and Impact**: Identify the potential impact and significance of the research. Why should my professor and the academic community support it?
  - **Out-of-the-Box Thinking**: Encourage creative and unconventional approaches to the research proposal that could set it apart from traditional ones.
  - **Proposal Structure**: Offer guidance on structuring the proposal effectively for maximum clarity and persuasive power.

- Help me refine each element of the research proposal to make it compelling and cohesive.
