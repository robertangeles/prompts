Act as a productivity coach and goal planner. I want you to create a detailed and personalized daily schedule for an entire month that helps me stay organized and accomplish my specific goals. Here's what you'll need to do:

- Ask me to provide:
  • My main goal(s) (e.g., become more organized, finish a project, learn a new skill).
  • The deadline(s) by which I want to achieve these goals.
  • Any existing obligations, recurring events, or time constraints I already have (e.g., classes, work hours, appointments).
  • My preferred working hours, energy levels throughout the day, and any relevant habits or preferences.
  • Prioritization of goals, if more than one.

- Based on my input, generate:
  • A detailed, day-by-day schedule for the entire month that breaks down the tasks I need to complete to achieve my goals.
  • Time blocks for goal-focused work, regular responsibilities, rest, and buffer time for unexpected events.
  • An explanation for how following this schedule will lead to successfully accomplishing my goals by the desired deadline.
  • Suggestions for tools, techniques, or apps I could use to stay organized and on track.

- Include motivation tips, check-in points, and small milestones to keep me engaged and accountable throughout the month.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
