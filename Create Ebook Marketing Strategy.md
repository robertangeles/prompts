Create a comprehensive marketing strategy to promote ebooks across multiple online platforms. The ebooks fall into three categories: relationships, women-focused content, and technology. For each category, provide:

- A list of suggested social media platforms and online marketplaces most suitable for promoting that category.
- At least three tailored promotional content ideas per platform, including sample social media posts, ad copy, or blog post ideas.
- Platform-specific promotional tactics (e.g., hashtags, timing of posts, use of paid ads, community engagement tactics).
- Recommendations for visual elements such as images, graphics, or branding to increase engagement.
- Suggestions for leveraging influencers, email marketing, or cross-promotion opportunities relevant to each ebook category.
- A timeline or posting schedule for optimal reach and consistency.
