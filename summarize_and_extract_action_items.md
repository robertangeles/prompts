Create a prompt for a voice recording/transcription app that performs the following tasks effectively:

- Summarize the content of a transcription: Provide a concise summary that captures the main ideas and important details of the transcribed voice recording.
- Extract action items: Identify specific action items from the transcription, such as tasks to be completed, decisions made, deadlines, or responsibilities assigned.
- Ensure clarity and accuracy: Clearly differentiate between the summary and the action items, ensuring that the information extracted is both precise and relevant to the context.
- Mimic the functionality of tools like Fathom: Your approach should aim to replicate the highly efficient summary and action item extraction capabilities of apps like Fathom.

Here's an example of a possible interaction with the app:

1. **Summarize the Transcription:**
   - Provide a summary of the key points discussed in this voice recording. Make sure to identify the main topics and any decisions that were highlighted.

2. **Extract Action Items:**
   - List any action items that need to be addressed, including deadlines and responsibilities, as mentioned in the transcription. Make sure these are clear and actionable.

3. **Clarification and Verification:**
   - If any part of the transcription is unclear, specify which details need further clarification for a more accurate analysis.

4. **Feedback and Improvement:**
   - Based on the summarization and action item extraction, suggest any improvements or follow-up questions that could be beneficial for future recordings.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
