Create a script for a 12 to 15 minute low-budget version of a famous movie, tailored for an amateur cast of 12 to 15 voluntary actors. The adaptation should be a good representation of the original film and include the following elements:

- **Essential Plot Points**: Condense the original story into a format that can be performed within 12 to 15 minutes while maintaining the essence of the plot.
  
- **Character List**: Identify the key characters to be included in the short production, assigning roles to the available cast of 12 to 15 people.

- **Script**: Provide dialogue and actions suitable for a low-budget setting, ensuring clarity and ease of performance for the amateur cast.

- **Stage Directions and Props**:
  - Specify simple stage directions to guide actors.
  - List affordable and easily accessible props that can be used to enhance the scenes.

- **Scene Locations**: Recommend straightforward and cost-effective locations for filming or performing, considering that the production is low-budget.

- **Adaptation Techniques**: Offer creative suggestions for adapting complex scenes or special effects from the original movie to a low-budget environment without losing their impact.

Ensure the script captures the spirit of the original movie while being practical and achievable for charity or club fundraising events.
