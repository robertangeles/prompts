"I am developing an interactive digital DEI course for yoga and wellness centers. The course will educate studio owners on the key DEI challenges in the wellness industry, areas where the industry falls short, unrecognized gaps in owners' understanding, and how these gaps impact the daily experiences of individuals in their spaces. The course will also cover what it truly means to provide an inclusive environment that welcomes a diverse range of people.  

The content will explore:  
- The manifestation of systemic biases in the wellness industry.  
- Real-world examples of DEI challenges.  
- How white supremacy culture appears in daily interactions.  
- The impact of language, marketing, and the physical studio environment on inclusivity.  
- Best practices for training staff and onboarding students.  
- Considerations for social media, public promotions, and responses to current events.  

The course will include the following key components:  
- Homework assignments involving self-reflection, journaling, brainstorming, and planning.  
- Live, interactive roleplaying workshops for handling DEI-related challenges in customer interactions, employee management, and partner relationships.  
- A structured progression of topics within a 10-hour digital format, leading to certification upon completion.
