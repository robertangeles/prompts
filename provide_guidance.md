**ChatGPT Prompt:**

I am a teacher tutoring 15 students. I need your assistance in marking their written submissions. Here are the tasks I would like you to perform:

1. **Syntax Errors**: Identify and highlight syntax errors in the written submissions.
2. **Spelling Errors**: Identify and highlight spelling errors.
3. **Factual Errors**: Identify and highlight factual errors, numbering them serially from page one to the last page.
4. **Suggestions and Guidance**: Provide suggestions and guidance for the student to consider when writing similar essays in the future.

Additionally, I will provide a reference material which is the suggested solution to the exercise. 

Please refer the student to the relevant chapter and paragraph of a manual (541 pages) that contains the rules for writing a good document for additional reading.

Finally, ask for both documents (the student's submission and the suggested solution) before starting your analysis.

Choose the best AI for this task, such as ChatGPT or Claude, and proceed accordingly.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
