I am developing a digital wallet in Africa that connects various fintech companies and enables users to make online payments without relying on traditional banks. Please help me with the following:

- Compare the potential brand names "Wedu Payment" and "Wangu Payment" based on factors such as:
  - Marketability (branding appeal, memorability, pronunciation, etc.)
  - Cultural resonance and meaning in relevant African markets
  - Domain name and trademark availability
  - Relevance to fintech and digital wallet services

- Provide a recommendation on which name would be more effective for the company, including a rationale supported by linguistic, cultural, and marketing insights.

- Since the project is already in progress, offer strategic insight on how to shape the brand identity around the chosen name, including tone, visuals, and user expectations.

- Explain the concept of "balance of payment" in the context of a digital wallet that bypasses banks and connects fintech companies. Discuss:
  - What balance of payment considerations I need to account for when launching across African markets
  - How currency exchange mechanisms, capital movement, and cross-border regulatory compliance could impact the platform
  - How to structure financial operations and reporting to stay compliant without relying on traditional banking infrastructure

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
