Create a comprehensive analysis prompt to derive insights, present information, and suggest the best visualizations for research data related to diet, nutrition, lifestyle habits, and cognitive resilience. Here's what I need you to consider and include:

- **Overview of the Data**: Assume you have access to a dataset that includes anonymous data on individuals' diet habits, lifestyle habits, cognitive scores, and more. Understand the context and any relevant variables that could impact cognitive resilience or risks of dementia.
  
- **Data Cleaning**: Begin by describing the process to clean, normalize, and prepare the dataset for analysis. What types of data discrepancies or issues might be common in such datasets, and how can they be addressed?

- **Statistical Analysis**: Identify key statistical methods to analyze relationships between diet, nutrition, lifestyle habits, and cognitive scores. Describe the analyses that could reveal meaningful patterns and correlations.

- **Insight Generation**: Specify techniques for generating insights into the impact of lifestyle and diet on cognitive resilience. How can the data be leveraged to identify trends, anomalies, and significant patterns?

- **Visualization Techniques**: Recommend the most effective charts or graphs to visualize data patterns, such as scatter plots for correlation analysis, bar charts for categorical data comparisons, and line graphs for trend analysis. Explain why these visualizations are suitable for this dataset.

- **Interpretation and Reporting**: Guide on how to interpret the results and convey them in a comprehensive manner, focusing on actionable insights for promoting health via diet and lifestyle changes.

Please provide the analysis step-by-step and feel free to ask for details or clarifications about any aspect of the dataset or objectives to ensure thorough understanding and accurate analysis.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
