**ChatGPT Prompt:**  

"I need to draft a compelling case to present to a UK university's principal, arguing against the non-graduation of a medical student due to the universityâ€™s failure to provide an adequate duty of care. The case should be legally robust and structured around mental health, equality laws, and duty of care obligations. Additionally, the university exacerbated the student's mental health challenges by imposing additional pressures unrelated to academics, which later escalated into a fitness-to-practice issue.  

Please generate a formal argument covering the following key points:  

- **Duty of Care**: Explain the legal and ethical responsibility of UK universities towards students, especially those with mental health concerns. Cite relevant UK legal frameworks, such as the Equality Act 2010 and any applicable higher education policies.  
- **Mental Health Considerations**: Highlight how improper handling of mental health issues can lead to discrimination and a breach of duty of care. Reference medical and psychological perspectives on how poor institutional support can worsen mental health conditions.  
- **Equality and Non-Discrimination**: Explain how the university's actions may have violated the Equality Act 2010, particularly regarding reasonable adjustments for mental health conditions as a protected disability.   
- **Fitness to Practice in a Medical Context**: Address how mental health is handled in fitness-to-practice evaluations, and whether discriminatory or undue pressure should have been avoided. Provide examples of best practices from UK regulatory bodies such as the General Medical Council (GMC).  
- **Legal and Procedural Precedents**: Include references to similar past cases where universities overturned decisions related to non-graduation due to inadequate support.  
- **A Face-Saving Resolution**: Present a logical and legally sound way for the university to reverse its decision without admitting liability, such as reconsidering the decision via a special review board or applying mitigating circumstances retroactively.   

Ensure the argument is structured, legally sound, and persuasive. Conclude with a clear call to action, asking for the reversal of the decision and immediate award of the medical degree.
