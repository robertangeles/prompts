Create a detailed guide for developing a blockchain application using Solidity for a University to generate degree certificates. The application should meet the following requirements:

- **Blockchain Functionality**:
  - Implement functionality to generate and store degree certificates on the blockchain.
  - Each degree certificate should include:
    - Student's name
    - Student's ID
    - Year received
    - Field of study

- **Smart Contract Development**:
  - Outline how to write a smart contract in Solidity that securely captures and stores the above information.
  - Ensure the contract includes mechanisms for verifying the integrity and authenticity of the stored data.

- **Front-end Integration**:
  - Describe how to develop an API that interfaces with the smart contract.
  - Include instructions on setting up a front-end application that allows users (administrators) to input the necessary student information and retrieve stored degree data.

- **Security Considerations**:
  - Address potential security risks and propose methods to mitigate these, such as data encryption and access controls.

- **Deployment and Testing**:
  - Provide a step-by-step guide for deploying the blockchain application and smart contracts.
  - Offer strategies for testing the application to ensure it functions as intended.
