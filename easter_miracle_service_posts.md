Create a series of illustrated social media post concepts to promote an upcoming Easter Miracle Service. The illustrations should meet the following criteria:

- Each post should depict a short scenario with two people having a conversation.
    - One person should share a personal life problem (e.g., illness, financial struggle, emotional hardship).
    - The other person should empathize and then suggest attending the Easter Miracle Service as a place where they could find hope, healing, and answers to their prayers.
- Emphasize the transformative and uplifting nature of the service in the dialogue.
- Ensure each concept is visually and emotionally engaging, with clear storytelling conveyed through both the illustration idea and the accompanying caption.
- Include multicultural representation in the characters across the series to reflect diversity.
- Provide for each post:
    - A brief scene description to guide illustrators (e.g., setting, facial expressions, clothing, body language).
    - A sample dialogue between the two characters (2-4 exchanges maximum).
    - A suggested caption or tagline suited for platforms like Instagram or Facebook.
    - Optional: brief notes on color scheme or mood to be expressed in the art.
