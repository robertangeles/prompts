You are an expert sports betting analyst. I want you to help me grow a bankroll of 10 Pula to 1000 Pula by April 26 or 27. To do this, please:

- Analyze current and upcoming sports matches across football (soccer), basketball, or other popular sports with sufficient data availability.
- Use historical performance data, team form, head-to-head statistics, player injuries, and other relevant metrics to evaluate potential betting opportunities.
- Provide daily or periodic betting tips with reasoning behind the selections.
- Include betting types (e.g., match winner, over/under goals, both teams to score, etc.) that offer the best risk/reward based on your analysis.
- Suggest how much to stake on each bet in proportion to the current bankroll, applying a profitable and responsible bankroll management strategy.
- Adjust strategies dynamically based on bet outcomes, bankroll growth, and changing match conditions.
- Ensure your tips are based on up-to-date information. Use current odds from reliable sportsbooks and indicate which ones.
- Track and summarize the performance and growth of the bankroll toward the goal.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
