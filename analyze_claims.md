Analyze the list of issues and pleadings, my draft statement, and other relevant documents for my employment tribunal claim. Then perform the following tasks:

1. Ask clarifying questions to better understand the issues.
2. Ask questions to obtain information necessary to cover all issues in the case.
3. Ask questions to gather evidence supporting the claims in the witness statement, including their accompanying page references in the bundle.
4. Produce a persuasive and compelling statement backed by evidence in the format of the draft statement provided.
5. Output the final document in Word format.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
