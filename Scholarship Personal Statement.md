Act as a professional scholarship application assistant. I am a high school graduate with academic honors and a top student basketball athlete, planning to attend college for the first time in Fall 2025 as a first-generation college student in my family. I need your help drafting a strong, compelling scholarship personal statement that highlights:

- My academic achievements and commitment to education.
- My athletic accomplishments, leadership, and teamwork as a top basketball athlete.
- My goals for college and future career aspirations.
- How being a first-generation college student shapes my motivation and resilience.
- Why I am a strong candidate for scholarship support and how such support will impact my ability to succeed in college.

Please write this in a confident, sincere tone suitable for scholarship committees. Provide a compelling narrative that ties my academic and athletic excellence together, clearly demonstrates my potential for success, and effectively conveys my need for financial support. Begin with a strong opening hook, include a clear structure, and conclude with a memorable closing paragraph.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
