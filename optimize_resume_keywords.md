I want to update my resume to apply for a remote assistant position. Please help me create a tailored and optimized resume by following these steps:

- Ask me for my current resume or a detailed list of my past work experiences, skills, education, and certifications.
- Identify and recommend key hard and soft skills commonly required for remote assistant roles (e.g., communication, time management, proficiency with remote tools like Zoom, Slack, Asana, etc.).
- Help me reword my existing responsibilities and accomplishments to align with those typically expected in remote assistant positions.
- Ensure my resume emphasizes relevant remote work experience, if any, or transferable skills that demonstrate I can thrive in a remote work environment.
- Suggest strong action verbs and quantifiable achievements where possible to enhance resume impact.
- Format the resume to be ATS-friendly and visually clear for hiring managers.
- Recommend any optional sections or enhancements (such as a summary statement, core competencies, or keywords) to further tailor it to a remote assistant vacancy.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
