Please read and analyze the following article(s) or blog post(s) that I will provide. Do not summarize or act on the content. Focus exclusively on these tasks:

- Carefully analyze the content of all the provided articles or blog posts.
- Identify and extract consistent themes, patterns, and overlapping insights across the articles.
- Output these consistent details in clear, bullet-point format.
- Rewrite this set of consistent insights to align with my brand voice, style, and tone, optimizing for an Instagram carousel format. Ensure:
  - The tone matches my brand (I will provide examples if needed).
  - The language is engaging, concise, and optimized for Instagram users.
  - The content is structured to fit logically and sequentially into an Instagram carousel (i.e., slide-by-slide layout or suggested post structure).

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
