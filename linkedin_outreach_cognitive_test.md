Write a professional and persuasive LinkedIn outreach message targeted at academic or clinical researchers to promote a validated cognitive function test for research use. The message should be structured as a concise and scannable email-style message and must include the following components:

- A compelling subject line that captures attention and reflects the cognitive test’s value.
- A strong opening paragraph that:
  - Quickly establishes credibility (e.g., who is promoting the tool or the organization behind it).
  - Demonstrates clear relevance to the researcher’s work in cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, or clinical research.
- A brief and clear description of the cognitive function test, including:
  - Its purpose and what it measures.
  - The fact that it is scientifically validated.
  - Any unique features or competitive advantages over comparable tools.
- A bullet-point list or formatted section highlighting its key strengths, such as:
  - High reliability and validity
  - Easy-to-use interface or digital accessibility
  - Applicable clinical or research domains
  - Real-world use cases or success stories (make up an example if needed and clearly note it is illustrative)
- A concise explanation of how this tool benefits researchers, such as:
  - Enhancing data quality
  - Reducing data collection time
  - Increasing chances for publication or funding opportunities
- A clear and specific call-to-action, such as:
  - Scheduling a free demo
  - Accessing a trial version or sample data
  - Discussing potential research collaboration
- A professional, confident, and inviting tone
- Formatting optimized for readability on both desktop and mobile devices

Avoid academic jargon unless essential, and ensure the message remains conversational and tailored to a LinkedIn context.
