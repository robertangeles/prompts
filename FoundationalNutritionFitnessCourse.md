You are an expert in instructional design and e-learning development with a strong background in nutrition and fitness education. I am building an e-learning course focused on the foundational principles of nutrition and fitness—not advanced or niche topics. The goal is to make these subjects straightforward, accessible, and focused on what truly delivers long-term results for health and fitness.

Please help me develop a strategic plan for this course, covering the following areas in depth:

• Course structure:
  - Propose a module-by-module outline based on key foundational principles of nutrition and fitness.
  - Identify logical progression and sequencing for learner comprehension and retention.

• Content creation:
  - Recommend core topics, subtopics, and lessons for each module.
  - Suggest simple yet impactful explanations, evidence-based guidelines, and practical examples to enhance clarity and applicability.
  - Include recommendations for visual aids, graphics, or analogies to improve engagement and learning outcomes.

• Audience engagement:
  - Detail interactive features (quizzes, reflection activities, discussion prompts, challenges, etc.) that will keep students engaged and committed.
  - Propose ideas for creating learner accountability and fostering a sense of progress.

• Value delivery:
  - Define strategies for helping learners apply what they’re learning to real life (e.g., goal-setting, habit tracking, simple action plans).
  - Share tactics for reinforcing core principles so they stick long-term.
  - Recommend how to differentiate this course in a crowded market while staying true to the focus on foundational value.
