I need your help in identifying funding opportunities to support the development and promotion of a cognitive health-focused biobank. Here is what I need you to do:

- **Understand the Purpose**: Recognize that the biobank collects extensive data on diet, nutrition, and lifestyle factors related to cognitive health and provides a cognitive function test and a questionnaire assessing dementia risk, with subsequent advice for reducing such risk.
  
- **Explore Funding Sources**: Investigate potential funding opportunities from various sources, including:
  - Government grants and funding programs pertinent to health, cognitive research, or biobanking.
  - Private sector opportunities, such as corporations interested in cognitive health and wellness, or those that have corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives that align with our biobank's mission.
  - Non-profit organizations or foundations that offer grants or funding for health-related research, particularly in cognitive health or preventative healthcare.

- **Assess Grant Requirements**: Identify typical requirements and qualifications needed to apply for these grants or funding opportunities, focusing on criteria such as:
  - The biobank's mission alignment with the funding bodyâ€™s goals.
  - The need for demonstrating potential impact or value in cognitive health research.
  - Any reporting or collaboration requirements.

- **Consider Strategic Partnerships**: Suggest opportunities to partner with academic institutions, healthcare organizations, or technology firms that may offer in-kind support, resources, or collaborative funding for projects aligned with cognitive health improvement.

- **Provide Examples**: Where possible, provide specific examples of past grant recipients or relevant funded projects to guide strategic positioning for applications.
