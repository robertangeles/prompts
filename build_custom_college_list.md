Develop a detailed guide for aiding a high school student in building a tailored college list that aligns with various important criteria. Consider the following aspects:

- **Academic Abilities**: Analyze the student's academic performance, such as GPA, standardized test scores, and extracurricular achievements, and recommend colleges where they would likely be a competitive applicant.
  
- **Interests and Goals**: Assess the student's academic and personal interests, career aspirations, and preferred learning environment. Suggest colleges that offer strong programs, clubs, or opportunities in these areas.

- **Financial Situation**: Explore the financial aid options, scholarships, and tuition costs at potential colleges to find institutions that fit the student's budget. Consider the student’s eligibility for need-based or merit-based aid.

- **Location Preferences**: Determine the student’s preference for geographical location, including the type of campus environment (urban, suburban, rural), climate, and proximity to home.

- **Extracurricular Opportunities**: Emphasize the importance of clubs, sports, volunteer opportunities, and other extracurricular activities available at prospective colleges and how they align with the student’s interests.

- **Campus Culture and Values**: Investigate the campus culture, diversity, student body size, and values of the institutions to find a good personality fit for the student.

- **Application Deadlines and Requirements**: Provide information on important deadlines and specific application requirements for a diverse range of colleges (e.g., essays, letters of recommendation).

Guide the student through organizing this information into a manageable and coherent college list that they can further research or discuss with their advisers. Encourage them to periodically revisit and revise the list as needed.
