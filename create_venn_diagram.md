- Create a visual representation of a Venn diagram with three intersecting circles.
- Ensure each circle is distinctly labeled as follows:
  - Label one circle "MIND" and color it green.
  - Label another circle "PURPOSE" and color it red.
  - Label the third circle "PERSEVERANCE" and color it black.
- Clearly represent the overlapping areas between any two circles and the central area where all three circles intersect.
- Consider providing a brief explanation or interpretation for each section of the diagram, especially the intersections, to describe what characteristics or concepts might be shared or distinct in these areas.
- Use visual design principles to ensure clarity and readability of the diagram.
