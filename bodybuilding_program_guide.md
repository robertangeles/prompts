Create a 12-week bodybuilding-focused fitness program designed for beginner to intermediate lifters aiming to build lean muscle mass through progressive overload. The program should:

- Include 4 to 5 weekly workouts that target all major muscle groups
- Have clearly defined workouts with detailed sets, reps, rest periods, and a progressive overload strategy
- Focus on improving muscle definition and strength evenly across all muscle groups
- Limit the number of compound movements per workout to prevent excessive fatigue, and complement them with effective isolation exercises
- Be structured for long-term adherence, with a planned variation or a new set of exercises every 5 to 6 weeks while maintaining the same goals and principles
- Be safe and accessible to newer lifters, offering guidance or notes on proper form, recovery, and avoiding overtraining

Provide the program in a clear format including:

- Weekly workout schedule breakdown (e.g., Push/Pull/Legs, Upper/Lower, etc.)
- Exercise selection with progression example (e.g., increase load, reps, sets over time)
- Tips to measure and track progress
- Nutritional or recovery considerations that align with the goal of lean muscle development
