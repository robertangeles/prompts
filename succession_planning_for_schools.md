Create a detailed succession plan for a school transitioning from a long-serving retiring school director to a new replacement. The plan should ensure a smooth transfer of leadership while preserving institutional knowledge and maintaining stability for students, staff, and the broader school community. Address the following key areas:

- **Transition Strategy**: Outline the step-by-step process for transitioning from the retiring director to the new one, including key milestones and timelines.
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Identify critical institutional knowledge that should be documented and transferred, including key relationships, policies, and operational procedures.
- **Mentorship & Overlap Period**: Recommend a structured mentorship or overlap period where the retiring director actively supports and guides the incoming director.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Provide strategies for communicating and engaging with key stakeholders (teachers, staff, parents, and the community) to ensure transparency and trust in the transition process.
- **Cultural & Institutional Continuity**: Suggest ways to preserve the schoolâ€™s culture, values, and long-term vision while allowing the new director to introduce necessary changes.
- **Onboarding & Training**: Develop a structured onboarding and leadership development plan for the incoming director to ensure they quickly adapt and excel.
- **Crisis & Risk Management**: Identify potential risks and challenges that may arise during the transition and provide contingency plans to mitigate disruptions.
- **Performance Monitoring & Evaluation**: Recommend metrics for evaluating the success of the transition and strategies for ongoing support and feedback.

Provide a structured, actionable plan incorporating best practices in educational leadership and change management. Where relevant, cite case studies or proven succession strategies that have worked in similar contexts.
