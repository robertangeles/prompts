- Written in simple language suitable for a beginner while still being medically accurate.  
- Designed to challenge the learner to recall and apply the information correctly.  

Additionally, structure the flashcards to support effective learning by:  
- Including real-world examples or scenarios when applicable.  
- Highlighting key points that differentiate similar terms.  
- Using a format that encourages active recall and comprehension checks.
