You are a prompt engineer helping me create stable, consistent image generations using an AI image generator (such as DALL·E, Midjourney, or any other visual model). I want to create a series of visuals featuring children wearing a white t-shirt that displays one of our black-and-white coloring book-style designs. These designs are intended to be colored in by the child who wears the shirt. I will upload these design illustrations separately, and I want them placed clearly and accurately on the front of the t-shirt worn by the kid in the image. Your task is to help structure prompts that:

- Enable AI to generate high-quality visuals of kids wearing a white t-shirt with a black-and-white line art illustration placed prominently on the shirt.
- Ensure the uploaded black-and-white illustration appears correctly without distortion or modification to the artwork's proportions, line style, or layout.
- Make it possible to show progressive changes, such as:
  - A second image where part of the illustration is hand-colored (e.g., using crayons or markers, as if a child started coloring it in).
  - A third image where more of the artwork is colored in, maintaining the same design structure, layout, and style on the t-shirt.

Ensure that each prompt maintains:
- The same perspective, environment, and t-shirt placement on the child’s body across multiple generations.
- Consistent proportions, scale, and fidelity of the original artwork upload across all image generations.

Also, advise on how to:
- Structure prompt text to ensure design consistency between image prompts generated in separate sessions/chats.
- Use seed values or reference images to maintain visual consistency when moving between prompts.
- Specify that only the coloring of the design changes, not the initial art style, layout, size, or placement on the t-shirt.

Guide me through this step-by-step and prepare the exact template text I can use with the AI image generator I’m using. Include sample prompts for:
1. The original design (black and white) on the child's t-shirt.
2. A partial coloring-in version of the illustration.
3. The same image with full or more advanced coloring.
