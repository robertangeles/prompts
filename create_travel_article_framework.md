Create a reusable ChatGPT prompt framework that I can use to generate a detailed, brand-consistent travel article about any city, simply by swapping out the city name. The prompt should instruct ChatGPT to:

- Write a high-quality travel article of approximately 9,000 words.
- Use an engaging, informative, and personable tone appropriate for travel blog readers.
- Follow a consistent structure that can be reused for any city. This structure should include:
  - Introduction to the city, including a brief history and what it's known for.
  - Best time of year to visit and why.
  - Top attractions and must-see landmarks.
  - Local neighborhoods to explore and their unique characteristics.
  - Suggested itineraries, including day-by-day breakdowns for different trip lengths (e.g., 1-day, 3-day, 5-day).
  - Culinary highlights and must-try local foods and restaurants.
  - Cultural experiences, festivals, art, and music scenes.
  - Practical tips for travelers (getting around, safety, budgeting, language tips, etc.).
  - Lesser-known attractions or hidden gems.
  - Recommended resources or links for additional planning.
- Emphasize SEO best practices, including helpful subheadings, keywords, and readability.
- Include bullet points, short paragraphs, and formatting elements to enhance readability.
- Ensure the article feels comprehensive yet easy to navigate.

Please write the prompt in a way that I can use it in the future by simply changing the city name and still get a consistent, brand-aligned output every time.
