**ChatGPT Prompt:**  

I need you to generate short, engaging drama stories (500-700 characters) tailored for TikTok and YouTube Shorts. These stories should be suspenseful, dramatic, and action-packed to capture the audience’s attention and leave them stunned. Follow these guidelines:  

- **Story Structure:**  
  - Start with an immediate hook to grab attention within the first sentence.  
  - Build tension and drama throughout, leading to a shocking or jaw-dropping climax.  
  - End with an engaging “what would you do?” prompt to encourage audience participation.  

- **Content Requirements:**  
  - Focus on relationship drama sub-niches, including betrayal, secrets, love triangles, revenge, and unexpected twists.  
  - Ensure each story features fresh character names and unique plots.  
  - Keep the language concise yet emotionally impactful.  
  - Maintain a tone that resonates with social media audiences.  

- **Format Example:**  
  - **Title**: (Compelling and attention-grabbing, e.g., “The Wedding Day Betrayal”)  
  - **Story:** (Engaging short-form narrative as per the guidelines)  
  - **Ending Hook:** (Thought-provoking question that sparks audience engagement, e.g., “Would you forgive or walk away?”)  

Generate **three** story ideas at a time so I have multiple options to choose from.
