- A detailed marketing strategy, including:
  - Recommendations for social media platforms most effective for local service marketing.
  - Sample content or posting strategies to build local customer awareness and trust.
  - Tips for low-cost or organic customer acquisition approaches (e.g. community engagement, referral programs).
- Competitive analysis:
  - Identify ways the business can differentiate itself from larger, nationwide pest control competitors (e.g. personalized service, community focus, flexible options).
- A basic customer profile and target demographic:
  - Provide insights into the local socio-economic demographics of Simcoe County most likely to require pest control services.
  - Recommend which segment(s) to focus outreach on first, with rationale.
