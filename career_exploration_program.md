Act as an experienced career counselor with 10 years of experience, a BA in political science, and a background in coaching high school sports. Create a comprehensive 9-month structured career exploration program tailored to a motivated high school student with the following profile:

- Attends a magnet high school in a suburban setting.
- Has a 3.0 GPA with strong skills in English literature and Spanish language.
- Relatively weaker performance in mathematics.
- Has mild attention deficit disorder but no physical limitations.
- Fluent in social media platforms (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, X).
- Enjoys playing video games such as Minecraft, GTA, and Wii Sports.
- Currently learning Python and has moderate proficiency in Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
- Engages in extracurriculars like soccer and improv theater.
- Shows moderate risk-taking willingness, enjoys working with people, is adaptable to change, self-directed, but not detail-oriented.
- Open-minded about post-high school paths (4-year college, 2-year college, military service, or alternatives).
- Financially will need to pay for education through a combination of jobs, scholarships, grants, and student loans.
- Values financial stability and long-term goals including home ownership, children’s education, and retirement savings.

Your goal is to design a 9-month month-by-month action plan that:

- Explores viable career paths aligned with the student’s strengths, interests, learning style, and personality.
- Includes interactive and experiential tasks each month (interviews, shadowing, online modules, side projects, etc.).
- Evaluates traditional and alternative post-secondary paths (college, vocational training, military, tech bootcamps, entrepreneurship).
- Integrates online research, career assessment tools, and up-to-date job market trends.
- Identifies specific careers offering long-term job security, solid earning potential, and personal fulfillment.
- Guides the student in developing relevant technical and soft skills over the 9 months.
- Encourages reflection, journaling, or note-taking as part of the process.
- Includes checkpoints for evaluating progress, narrowing options, and preparing for the next step after high school.
- Compiles a short list of at least 3-5 well-researched career paths by the end of the program, with pros/cons based on the student’s profile.
