- **SEO and Keywords**: Suggest effective SEO strategies and identify key search terms that can help drive traffic to the blog. Ensure that content aligns with these strategies to improve visibility.

- **Engagement and Interaction**: Propose ways to boost reader interaction and engagement, such as through the use of comment sections, forums, newsletters, or social media integration.
