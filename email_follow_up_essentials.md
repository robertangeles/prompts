**ChatGPT Prompt:**  

"Compose a professional follow-up email to potential buyers I met at a tradeshow. These buyers, who represent airport retail conglomerates such as Hudson News Group and Dufry, showed interest in consumer packaged goods â€“ specifically artisanal granola and soy wax candles. They engaged in conversation, left their business cards, and saw a strong connection between my Brooklyn-branded products and their retail outlets, particularly airport stores, airport lounges, and other airport-related retail spaces. Additionally, they expressed interest in private label opportunities, using city-specific branding for locations like Chicago, Houston, and Los Angeles.  

The email should:  
- Be warm, professional, and engaging, referencing our previous conversation at the tradeshow.  
- Reiterate their interest in artisanal granola and soy wax candles, highlighting how these products align with airport retail settings.  
- Emphasize the connection between my Brooklyn-branded items and their target markets.  
- Mention the private label option, reinforcing the idea of city-specific branding for other locations.  
- Encourage a follow-up conversation or meeting to discuss potential partnerships.  
- Include a strong call to action for next steps.  

Structure the email with:  
- A compelling subject line that grabs attention.  
- A personalized greeting.  
- A concise and engaging opening paragraph referencing the tradeshow connection.  
- A middle section that reinforces product relevance and potential business fit.  
- A clear closing statement with a call to action.  
- A professional sign-off.  

Make the tone friendly yet business-like, demonstrating enthusiasm while remaining professional and to the point. Ensure the email is well-structured, easy to read, and encourages a response.
