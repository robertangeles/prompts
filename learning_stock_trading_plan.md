Create a detailed study plan and study schedule for learning stock trading, with a focus on day trading, over a two-year period with the ultimate goal of trading full-time. The plan should guide the individual from foundational principles to more advanced strategies, incorporating the following elements:

- Begin with foundational principles of stock trading, including market terminology, basic financial analysis, and understanding stock market indices.
- Progress to intermediate concepts such as technical analysis, risk management, and chart patterns.
- Advance to more complex strategies involving options and futures trading, including options greeks, hedging strategies, and futures contracts.
- Incorporate practical activities such as paper trading and backtesting trading strategies with historical data.
- Suggest resources such as books, online courses, trading simulators, and community forums for each learning stage.
- Recommend a daily and weekly study schedule that balances learning and practice, with specific time allocations for different topics.
- Include strategies for maintaining discipline, tracking progress, and adjusting the study plan as needed.
- Provide guidance on transitioning to full-time trading, including setting financial goals, managing trading capital, and maintaining a sustainable trading lifestyle.
