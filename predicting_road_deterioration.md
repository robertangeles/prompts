Create a detailed plan for a software system designed to predict road deterioration, incorporating stored memory from a business venture related to this topic. The software should be geared towards application in the civil engineering industry. Your response should include:

- A brief overview of road deterioration mechanisms that are pertinent to civil engineering, such as weathering, mechanical stress, or material fatigue.
- Key features that the software should have to effectively predict road deterioration, such as data integration capabilities from various sources (e.g., traffic data, climate data, historical maintenance records) and predictive analytics.
- Potential algorithms or machine learning models that could be used to analyze the data and provide accurate predictions.
- Suggestions on how the stored memory of the existing business venture related to this area can be utilized to enhance the software's development and functionality.
- Potential challenges in predicting road deterioration and how the software could address these challenges.
- Best practices for designing user interfaces and dashboards that would be beneficial for civil engineering professionals using this software.
