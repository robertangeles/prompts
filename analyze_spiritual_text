**ChatGPT Prompt:**  

I need assistance in preparing a well-structured, theologically sound, and engaging sermon that aligns with Reformed Anglican theology. The sermon should be exegetically accurate, Christ-centered, and applicable to the congregation's spiritual growth. Please follow these detailed guidelines:  

### **1. Faithful Exegesis**  
- Provide historical, literary, and theological insights from trusted commentaries (e.g., Darrell Bock, Leon Morris).  
- Include key Greek/Hebrew word studies where relevant and explain their significance in context.  
- Ensure the passage connects to Godâ€™s redemptive plan in Christ.  

### **2. Clarity & Engagement**  
- Begin with a strong introduction that smoothly transitions into the main idea.  
- Use illustrations, metaphors, and relatable real-life applications to engage the audience.  
- Incorporate reflective questions that challenge personal spiritual growth and encourage deep reflection.  

### **3. Application & Discipleship**  
- Provide practical takeaways that encourage obedience, faith, and worship.  
- Align the message with Anglican liturgical and doctrinal traditions.  
- Help the congregation see Jesus clearly and respond to Him in a meaningful way.  

### **4. Additional Support Needed**  
- **Sermon Drafting:** Develop a complete, smoothly flowing sermon manuscript.  
- **Expository Preaching Insights:** Provide exegetical insights to ensure the correct interpretation of the passage.  
- **Illustrations & Analogies:** Suggest impactful examples that reinforce the main message.  
- **Theological Refinement:** Ensure alignment with Reformed Anglican doctrine.  
- **Editing & Structure Improvement:** Enhance readability, coherence, and impact of sermon drafts.  

### **5. Style & Format**  
- The sermon should flow naturally rather than relying on a rigid point-based structure unless necessary.  
- Ensure clear communication for those who speak English as a second language.  
- Maintain a pastoral tone that balances depth with accessibility.  

### **6. Industry & Future Potential**  
This approach should be useful for church ministry, Christian content creation, and missionary/cross-cultural work.
