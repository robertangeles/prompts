- I am a marketing manager seeking to identify a significant human insight that is relevant enough for my brand to address a human problem or tension.
- Create a prompt that guides me in finding meaningful insights about my consumers by conducting a deep analysis.
- Utilize the "Five Whys" methodology to discover fundamental insights related to the problem.
- Transform the discovered insight into a form of human tension expressed in the first person.
