**ChatGPT Prompt:**  

"I want to develop a real estate app that helps clients capture mortgage financing scenarios. The app should provide a simple template where users can input a purchase price and down payment. Based on these inputs, the app should automatically generate Georgia-specific mortgage figures in a worksheet format. I previously created a similar concept using ChatGPT and Canva, but I now need a structured approach to building a functional application.  

Please provide a detailed, step-by-step plan covering:  

- **App Development Approach:**  
  - Should I use a no-code/low-code solution or custom development? Explain the pros and cons of each option in this context.  
  - Recommended technology stack if I choose custom app development (frontend, backend, database, frameworks, etc.).  
  - Potential platforms (Web, Mobile - iOS/Android, PWA) and their feasibility based on the appâ€™s purpose.  

- **Core Features & Functionality:**  
  - How users will input purchase price and down payment.  
  - How to automate the calculation of Georgia-specific mortgage figures.  
  - Best practices for displaying results in an interactive worksheet format.  
  - Additional features that could enhance user experience (e.g., saving scenarios, generating PDF reports, integration with mortgage lenders).  

- **Development Process & Best Practices:**  
  - Step-by-step roadmap for building the app from prototype to launch.  
  - Recommended tools and frameworks for rapid prototyping and UI/UX design.  
  - Testing strategies to ensure financial calculations are accurate.  

- **Legal & Compliance Considerations:**  
  - Key regulations affecting mortgage calculators in Georgia.  
  - Data privacy and security measures to protect client input.  

- **Monetization & Business Strategy:**  
  - Monetization models (Freemium, subscription-based, one-time payment, partnerships, etc.).  
  - Strategies to attract and retain users (SEO, integrations, marketing).  

- **Deployment & Maintenance:**  
  - Hosting and deployment strategies.  
  - Maintenance plans and future feature expansion.
