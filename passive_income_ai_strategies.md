**ChatGPT Prompt:**  

I am looking to create a passive income stream leveraging AI, particularly ChatGPT prompting, without engaging in hands-on coaching. I have experience in healthcare leadership, business operations, generational differences in the workplace, and leadership coaching. I also have a certification from the John Maxwell Leadership Academy. I want to identify a niche that:  

- Generates sustainable passive income  
- Requires minimal direct time investment  
- Provides value to healthcare professionals or leaders  
- Leverages AI tools, templates, e-books, or digital downloads  
- Potentially involves a paid community or chatbot integration  
- Is modeled after successful online creators who monetize AI content  

**Your task:**

   - Based on my background and interests, suggest 3-5 viable niches where AI and leadership intersect.  
   - Ensure these niches have market demand while not being overly saturated.

   - Explain the pros and cons of each in terms of scalability and effort required.  

3. **Content & Product Strategy**  
   - Suggest a framework for creating in-demand AI-powered digital products like templates, e-books, and chatbots for my target audience.  
   - Provide a content roadmap that builds authority while generating revenue.  
   - Outline a strategy to repurpose content across different platforms to build an audience.  

4. **AI-Powered Community & Automation**  
   - Explore ways to build a monetizable online community for healthcare professionals or leaders, using AI-driven engagement.  
   - Suggest chatbot implementation ideas to enhance passive income generation.  
   - Recommend best practices for maintaining community engagement with minimal ongoing effort.  

5. **Marketing & Growth Strategy**  
   - Outline a step-by-step plan for establishing an online presence, including necessary platforms (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn, email marketing).  
   - Recommend strategies for audience building, lead generation, and conversion into paid products.  
   - Provide insights on how to model after successful creators in the space while differentiating offerings.  

6. **Implementation Plan & Next Steps**  
   - Create a phased plan for launching this business, from idea validation to scaling.  
   - List key tools and resources needed for execution.
