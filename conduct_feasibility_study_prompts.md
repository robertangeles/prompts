You are helping to write a section of a book on conducting a feasibility study within the manufacturing industry, with a specific focus on the food manufacturing sector. Generate a comprehensive set of ChatGPT prompts that can guide users through the major stages of a feasibility study. Each prompt should be tailored to help end users gather insights or perform analysis for the following core components:

- Market feasibility
  - Prompts to help identify target customers, assess demand, analyze competitors, determine pricing strategies, and evaluate market trends specific to the food manufacturing industry.
  
- Technical feasibility
  - Prompts to assist in evaluating required technologies, equipment, raw materials, production processes, facility requirements, and compliance with food industry standards and regulations.

- Financial feasibility
  - Prompts to estimate startup costs, operating costs, projected revenues, breakeven analysis, funding requirements, and return on investment (ROI) tailored to food manufacturing.

For each section above, include:
- At least 3 highly actionable, detailed prompts that guide users to uncover insights or data.
- Prompts that encourage structured and comprehensive answers (suggest how the response should be formatted, if applicable).
- Variability in prompt types: include hypothetical scenario analysis, comparative analysis, and questions designed for deep strategic thinking.

The end goal is to create prompts that can be embedded into an app to help small food manufacturers or entrepreneurs conduct feasibility studies independently.
