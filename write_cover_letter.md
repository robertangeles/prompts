Please help me craft a high-quality introductory letter for potential employers. The letter should:

- Be concise yet informative
- Highlight my skills, experiences, and contributions from my resume
- Include a link to my website

Also, please help me compose a compelling subject line to draw the employer's attention. Make sure the subject line piques their interest to open and read the letter.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
