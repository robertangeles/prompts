I am meeting Matt Forrest today to explore how I can leverage his services for learning and building an app in the geospatial industry. I am both a founder and a hands-on developer, so I want to tailor my discussion to cover both these perspectives. Here's the information about Matt's offering and what I need to address in my conversation:

- Matt's offering is called "Spatial Lab," which is a membership community designed to improve geospatial technology skills in a flexible and cost-effective way.
- Spatial Lab includes access to courses, tutorials, workshops, a resource library, and community support and networking. 
- The focus is on modern, open tools with the goal of mastering technologies like geospatial Python, machine learning, spatial SQL, and more.
- The Lab promises a structured learning approach, real-world application, and supportive community engagement.
- Pricing is set at $49 per month with options for discounts with annual plans and purchase power parity opportunities depending on the region.

For my conversation with Matt, I need to cover the following:

**Founder Perspective:**
- How can Spatial Lab services be integrated into scaling and innovating in the geospatial industry?
- What unique advantages does Spatial Lab offer over traditional courses or programs in attracting and retaining talent?
- Can Spatial Lab content be customized or specialized to align with specific business objectives or solutions in the geospatial app development process?
- Discuss the potential for collaboration or partnerships between startups and Spatial Lab.

**Developer Perspective:**
- What specific skills will I gain in the context of geospatial app development through Spatial Lab courses and resources?
- How does Spatial Lab ensure the practical application of skills learned, and how can that be integrated into actual development projects?
- Are there specific examples of success stories or projects from other developers who have used Spatial Lab resources?
- How accessible are the community forums and support for technical questions and learning new tools?

Please provide conversation points and detailed questions addressing these topics for a productive meeting with Matt Forrest.
