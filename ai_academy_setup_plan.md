Help me design a comprehensive plan to set up an AI Academy for kids. The program will initially be free, but later introduce paid subscriptions that will support additional programs for underserved learners. I need a detailed and actionable setup that includes the following components:

• A step-by-step implementation roadmap for launching the AI Academy for kids, including:
  - Curriculum design suitable for different age groups and skill levels
  - Recommended online tools, platforms, and teaching resources
  - Suggested lesson plans, projects, and interactive learning activities
  - Guidelines for delivery format (e.g., live sessions, recorded videos, self-paced)

• A list of available free or affordable resources, tools, and platforms to help develop and deliver the program (e.g., open-source curricula, free coding platforms, educational AI simulators)

• A marketing strategy with social media content ideas to attract and grow an audience of parents, kids, and educators, including:
  - Suggested platforms to use (e.g., Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, LinkedIn)
  - Weekly social media content calendar for the first month
  - Engaging post types (reels, quizzes, challenges, testimonials)
  - Tips for building community and increasing engagement

• A sustainable monetization plan, including:
  - When and how to introduce paid subscriptions
  - How to communicate the philanthropic angle (funds channeled into courses for students in need)
  - Possible value-added services for paying subscribers (certificates, mentorship, advanced content)

• An outreach and partnership strategy to connect with schools, parents, nonprofit organizations, and tech companies for support or collaboration
