Create a compelling, professionally written social media promotional campaign for a personal trainer whose client base primarily uses Ozempic. The goal is to attract new clients to the gym by addressing the common issue that many people using Ozempic are experiencing: rapid weight loss leading to saggy skin or an unhealthy appearance. The content should:

- Explain in simple, relatable terms how rapid weight loss without proper strength and resistance training can lead to muscle loss and a saggy or unhealthy look.
- Educate the audience on how this can be prevented or improved through proper strength training and individualized fitness coaching.
- Position the personal trainerâ€™s services as a specialized solution aimed at people on Ozempic who want to retain lean muscle, look healthy, and feel strong during their weight loss journey.
- Include two to three versions of social media copy tailored for different formats (e.g., short-form for Instagram Stories, medium-form for Facebook posts, long-form for LinkedIn).
- Offer a persuasive call-to-action encouraging viewers to take the next step (e.g., book a consultation, try a session, download a guide).
- Maintain a tone that is supportive, confident, and non-judgmental while still conveying expertise.
