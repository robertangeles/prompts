Create an image prompt that can generate a realistic before-and-after showcase of a house that has undergone transformations, essential for demonstrating house raising projects on social media platforms. 

- Specify the initial scene as a single-story house. Emphasize key details such as the architecture style, color, and existing features of the house, ensuring they remain identifiable in both images.
- For the after image, describe the desired changes: a transformation to a two-story house with new windows, modern siding, and updated exterior elements. Specify any additional architectural adjustments or design enhancements you want.
- Reinforce the need for the second image to closely match the foundational characteristics of the first — for example, the house's color, shape, and location in relation to landmarks or surroundings — to maintain a realistic portrayal.
- Mention any specific styles, materials, or themes that are preferred for the new construction work, such as contemporary, rustic, or traditional designs.
- Advise on image composition for clarity and continuity, suggesting an identical viewpoint, lighting, and angle for both pictures to ensure a visually compelling and coherent before-and-after effect.
- Highlight the intended platforms for sharing the images, such as Instagram and Facebook, to account for format and resolution recommendations specific to those services (e.g., aspect ratios, pixel dimensions).
