Using the following Zoho CRM data fields, generate a concise, structured, and actionable B2B sales discovery call preparation brief. The brief is intended for a B2B sales strategist to use in preparation for an upsell call to an existing customer or an introductory call to a new lead. The tone should be professional yet friendly, and the output should be skimmable—use bullet points, bolded section headers, and keep the content insight-driven. Avoid fluff and focus on strategic value.

Based on the data provided, generate the following sections:

1. **Company Overview**  
   - Summarize what the company does and its positioning within its industry. Use website info if needed.

2. **Likely Pain Points**
