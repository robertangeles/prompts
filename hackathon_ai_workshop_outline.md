**ChatGPT Prompt:**  

Create a comprehensive workshop outline for a hackathon session focused on ideating AI solutions using ChatGPT and other methods. The workshop is part of a series and should guide participants through structured brainstorming techniques to generate AI-driven ideas. These ideas should be specifically tailored to a large consulting organization and should aim to improve efficiency, productivity, and effectiveness at four levels: individual, team, organization, and client.
