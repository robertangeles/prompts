- Explanations are clear, concise, and accurate, ensuring ease of learning.  

Provide the study guide in an easy-to-read format, such as a list of terms with mixed-up definitions, a table with two columns (one for terms and one for shuffled definitions), or another interactive format suitable for studying.
