**ChatGPT Prompt:**  

I am a language teacher running an after-school program, and I need your help designing interactive language-learning exercises for children aged 5 to 11. My goals for these exercises include:  

- Encouraging age-appropriate conversation and play.  
- Helping students communicate effectively with their teacher.  
- Practicing past, present, and future tenses in a natural way.  
- Including vocabulary related to dates, colors, numbers, places, activities, likes, and dislikes.  
- Reinforcing first-year grammar rules.  

Please generate a set of structured language-learning activities that align with these goals. The activities should be engaging, interactive, and adaptable to different languages. Specifically, I am looking for:  

1. **Conversational Scenarios**: Develop role-play scenarios where students practice speaking in a way that is fun and engaging (e.g., ordering food at a restaurant, talking about their favorite activities, planning a future trip). Provide sample dialogues with key phrases and prompts.  

2. **Grammar Practice**: Create simple yet effective exercises that reinforce past, present, and future tenses, ensuring that young learners grasp these concepts intuitively.  

3. **Vocabulary Reinforcement**: Suggest playful ways to teach and review vocabulary—including numbers, colors, days of the week, and emotions—through storytelling, songs, and games.  

4. **Teacher Communication Strategies**: Offer practical suggestions for how I, as the teacher, can guide students in their language practice, correct mistakes effectively, and encourage natural conversation.  

5. **Games & Interactive Exercises**: Provide ideas for activities that promote engagement, such as scavenger hunts, Simon Says, or board games adapted for language learning.  

Additionally, if available, share any best practices or resources on how to create the "perfect prompt" for language learning in AI tools like this one. If there are step-by-step frameworks or techniques for crafting better prompts that help students grasp new languages more effectively, please include those as well.  

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
