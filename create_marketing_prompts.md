Act as a creative strategist and content generator for an email marketing agency. I need you to generate high-quality prompts tailored for use across various AI platforms, including image generation tools (like Midjourney, DALLÂ·E, or Stable Diffusion) and large language models such as ChatGPT. The purpose of these prompts is to produce compelling visuals and persuasive copy that support email marketing campaigns and brand storytelling. Your output should include:

- Prompts for AI image generation that capture the visual identity, tone, and intent of different email campaigns (e.g., promotional, seasonal, product launch, re-engagement).
- Prompts for ChatGPT that generate sales copy, subject lines, calls to action, and personalized messaging strategies.
- Customization recommendations based on the industry, target audience, campaign goal, and emotional appeal.
- Suggestions for segmenting prompts by campaign type (e.g., welcome emails, abandoned cart, product upsell).
- Best practices for structuring prompts to maximize output quality across platforms.

Organize the prompts by use case and provide examples of expected results. Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
