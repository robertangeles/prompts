Create a prompt for generating a randomized set of quiz answer options. Here are the requirements your prompt should meet:

- Generate quiz answer options for a multiple-choice quiz, where the options (such as A, B, C, D) should be randomly distributed for each question.
- Ensure the distribution of option labels is balanced across the entire quiz, avoiding patterns or clusters.
- There should be a diverse spread of the correct answers across different option labels (A, B, C, D).
- Provide a set of example questions and options to demonstrate the randomized distribution.
- If possible, include a method to verify the randomness of the generated answers.
- Ensure that any proposed solution can be easily implemented and understood by a teacher creating quizzes.
