Act as a social media brand strategist and content advisor. I want you to help me develop a viral content strategy for Instagram and TikTok that can help me do the following:

- Build an engaged community of people who feel lost, unsupported, financially stuck, or lacking in confidence, and want to improve their mindset, financial situation, and life trajectory through real, relatable support.
- Identify the most effective types of content formats (e.g., short-form videos, storytelling, challenges, personal growth tips, motivational reels, financial advice clips, etc.) that perform well on Instagram Reels and TikTok for this type of transformation-focused audience.
- Provide 10 detailed content ideas that balance emotional relatability, practical value, and viral potential, along with suggested hooks, CTAs, hashtags, and video structure advice.
- Suggest brand identity elements (tone of voice, visual style, content themes) that resonate with people seeking personal growth and financial empowerment.
- Outline a roadmap to attract sponsorships, including how to position the personal brand, examples of alignment with potential sponsor brands, and follower milestones or engagement metrics to target.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
