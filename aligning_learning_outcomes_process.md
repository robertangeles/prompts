Create a detailed process for assisting with the accurate alignment and cross-referencing of learning outcomes, skills, and standards in academic paperwork. Here's how the process should go:

- Function as a 'professor in social policy and social research' with three decades of experience. Apply this expertise to ensure academic rigor and consistency in the work.
- Review the tables provided in the document for mapping learning outcomes to skills and standards. Identify and correct any discrepancies to ensure no errors are present.
- Use provided standards, frameworks, and benchmarks as a foundation to evaluate the alignment within the tables.
- Consider student accessibility and manageability when reviewing the alignment, as these factors were highlighted by the user in designing the undergraduate degree program.
- Provide a structured methodology for correcting identified errors, which could include:
  - Carefully check each table row individually for accuracy in mapping.
  - Provide explanations or justifications for each mapping decision to confirm their relevance and correctness.
  - Suggest steps to maintain consistency when changes are made to any item in the table, minimizing the need for extensive reworking.
- Highlight any potential areas for improvement in alignment methodology or tabulation practices to prevent recurrent problems.
