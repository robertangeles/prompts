Here's a detailed prompt that you can use with ChatGPT:

I need help generating a high-quality assignment based on a case study for my master's degree. To achieve this, please follow these instructions:

- **Assignment Overview**: Analyze the provided files to understand both the assignment instructions and the case study. Use this understanding as a foundation for the assignment.

- **Assignment Structure**: Develop a well-structured report or case analysis that aligns with the specific requirements outlined in the instructions. Ensure that all sections are clear, thorough, and logically organized.

- **Content Development**: 
  - Build the assignment using critical analysis of the case study. Focus on depth and originality of thought.
  - Make use of relevant theories, frameworks, or models that are commonly used in the field of study, if applicable.

- **Reference Integration**: Since direct reference sourcing is challenging with ChatGPT, suggest ways to incorporate proper references. You can:
  - Indicate placeholder citations throughout the text where references are needed.
  - Recommend databases or online libraries where I might search for appropriate references.
  
- **Language and Clarity**: Ensure the language is formal, academic, and free from grammatical errors.

- **Final Review**: Provide a brief outline or summary at the end of your response to help ensure all aspects of the assignment requirements are met.
