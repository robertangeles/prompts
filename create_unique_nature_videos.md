Act as a creative consultant and content strategy expert. I want to create relaxing rain and nature videos, but I want them to stand out from the countless similar videos available online. Provide a comprehensive and innovative strategy for how I can make my nature/rain videos unique and compelling for viewers. Your response should include:

- Creative differentiators: List at least 5 unique creative angles or themes that haven’t been overused in traditional rain/nature videos (e.g., narrative storytelling elements, unusual geographical settings, fantasy themes, integration of CGI or animation, etc.).
- Visual and audio innovation: Suggest specific techniques or tools to elevate the visuals and sound design – including ideas for immersive experiences, ASMR layering, or binaural audio use.
- Audience experience: Describe ways to enhance viewer engagement and emotional connection with the video – including interactive components, ambient sound variation, or guided meditative narration.
- Branding and style: Offer ideas for creating a consistent visual and thematic identity across videos to help viewers recognize the content as part of a unique brand.
- Content planning: Recommend an approach to scripting, filming (or generating via AI), and editing the videos to maximize quality and originality.
- Market gap analysis: Briefly outline common tropes used in typical rain/nature videos and explain how your suggestions differ from or improve on them.
