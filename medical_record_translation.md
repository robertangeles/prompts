Please help me with the following task:

I will provide you with a set of medical records, including:
- Handwritten notes.
- Typed medical documents.
- Results from blood tests.

Your objective is to create a comprehensive and easily understandable "translation" of these records into plain, layman's language. Assume the reader has no medical training or background knowledge. Your response must:

- Explain the medical conditions, procedures, diagnoses, treatments, and blood test results described in the records in simple, clear language.
- Define any medical terms or jargon encountered, using everyday comparisons or explanations.
- Summarize each section coherently without omitting important details, while avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- Offer an overall summary that connects all the information and provides the big picture regarding the patient's health, the meaning of test results, and next steps if applicable.
- Avoid using medical abbreviations or, if necessary, explain them clearly.
- Assume the reader will not google any terms for clarification â€” provide complete explanations within your response.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
