ChatGPT Prompt:

You are an expert career advisor specializing in leadership roles in education. I need detailed advice and counsel for my current career situation:

- I have accepted a position as Executive Director of a bilingual daycare but have not yet started. Per the contract, I would need to provide one month’s notice if I decide to resign.
- I am in the final stages of candidacy for a better-paying job at a bilingual primary school with superior benefits, but the hiring process is slow.
- A new opportunity has just opened up: CEO of a national professional association in education, a role I have been targeting for a year. The pay is less than the bilingual school but has good benefits. The recruitment process has just started, and competition may be high.
- I have 20 years of experience as a Head of School, and all roles are local (no relocation needed).

Given this context:

1. Advise me on how to gracefully give notice to the bilingual daycare if I accept the offer from the bilingual primary school. Include specific wording examples for the resignation letter and tips for managing the conversation professionally to minimize reputational risk.
2. Should I apply for the CEO position at the national organization even though the recruitment has just started and I already tentatively committed to the daycare? What strategic considerations should I keep in mind when balancing current commitments with applying for a highly desirable but uncertain opportunity?
3. Help me create a timeline and decision-making framework for how to proceed over the next 1–2 months considering all three opportunities. Include contingency planning depending on whether I move forward with the bilingual school, the CEO role, or stay with the daycare.
4. Offer general career strategy advice considering my long-term goals in educational leadership and network-building, given that connections may be important for the CEO role.

Make your advice structured, practical, and focused on minimizing professional risk while maximizing career growth. Use bullet points, timelines, example scripts, and action items wherever helpful.
