Compose a professional and well-crafted email addressed to the director of communications at a real estate development company overseeing a major revitalization project in Montreal. The email should:

- Politely inquire about plans for a primary school as part of the development, which includes shops, offices, residences, and a hotel.
- Express genuine interest in learning more about the educational component of the project.
- Introduce the sender professionally, highlighting their background and relevant experience in founding and managing schools.
- Emphasize the sender’s interest in contributing to the potential creation and management of the new school within the development.
- Ask if the development team is currently seeking or open to collaborating with a qualified individual to lead the school’s creation and administration.
- Maintain a tone that is respectful, polished, and demonstrates a clear understanding of the project's importance to the community.

Include a strong subject line and a professional signature. The email should be compelling enough to initiate a dialogue and position the sender as a potential asset to the educational component of the project.
